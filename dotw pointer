/*Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, and prints which day of the week that number corresponds to. The days are indexed from 0 (Sunday) to 6 (Saturday).

Store the names of the days in an array and print the name of the day in two ways:

with pointer arithmetic;
with array indexing.
Before the program gets a value from the array, it must first check if the given day is greater than or equal to zero and less than 7. If not, it should print the message: Error, no such day..

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output.
