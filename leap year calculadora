/*Write a program that computes and prints whether or not a given year is a leap year.

A leap year is a year that is exactly (without a remainder) divisible by four, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400.

Use the modulo operator and some logic operators in your program and try to write only one condition (of course you can now use the else keyword).
